        <h2 className="section-title">About NamasteDoctor</h2>
        <p className="about-description">
          Namaste Doctor is a youth-led initiative founded by an adolescent, with a vision to empower fellow adolescents by addressing a critical yet often overlooked aspect of their well-being‚Äîsexual and reproductive health. In Nepal, cultural taboos and social stigma frequently create barriers to open discussion on these topics, leading many young people to rely on misinformation or unsafe practices.
          <br /><br />
          At Namaste Doctor, we believe that sexuality is a natural and essential part of human life. Treating it as a taboo only deepens the cycle of ignorance and poor health outcomes. To break this silence, our platform was established with the guidance and support of licensed medical professionals in Nepal.
          <br /><br />
          We offer a safe, confidential, and judgment-free space where adolescents can directly consult qualified, verified doctors. All consultations are conducted with the utmost discretion, and users have the option to communicate in either English or Nepali, based on their comfort. Even while remaining anonymous, users can trust the credentials, integrity, and dedication of the healthcare professionals they interact with.
          <br /><br />
          Namaste Doctor is committed to providing accurate, evidence-based information and fostering an environment of trust and empowerment. Our goal is to help young people make informed decisions and take control of their sexual and reproductive health with confidence and clarity.
          <br /><br />
          Take the first step‚Äîbecause your health, dignity, and knowledge matter.
